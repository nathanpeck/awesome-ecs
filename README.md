### First steps

- [Amazon ECS Core Concepts](https://containersonaws.com/presentations/amazon-ecs-core-concepts/) - Introduction to core concepts of Amazon ECS, including what are containers, why it is important to decouple applications from their underlying compute infrastructure, how ECS works, and what integrations that ECS has with the rest of AWS.
- [Building Blocks of Amazon ECS](https://medium.com/containers-on-aws/building-blocks-of-amazon-ecs-db7fdfeeaa6f) - Learn about the basic building blocks of ECS and how they fit together to fully understand how it works and how you can use it!
- [ECS Workshop](https://ecsworkshop.com/) - A detailed workshop that guides you through creating a simple microservice deployment, load testing it, and monitoring it.
- [AWS Copilot](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/docs/getting-started/first-app-tutorial/) - The getting started guide for AWS Copilot helps you deploy your first simple static website container on Fargate.

### Pick your container hosting strategy:

- [Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate?](https://containersonaws.com/blog/2023/ec2-or-aws-fargate/) - Which compute capacity makes more sense for your workload: serverless AWS Fargate, or EC2 instances?
   * If you pick EC2 capacity learn about [ECS capacity providers linked to EC2 auto scaling groups](https://containersonaws.com/pattern/ecs-ec2-capacity-provider-scaling) and [running containers on EC2 spot capacity](https://containersonaws.com/pattern/ecs-spot-capacity-cluster) and consider [Bottlerocket](https://bottlerocket.dev/) as the [container focused operating system for your Amazon ECS cluster](https://containersonaws.com/pattern/ecs-ec2-bottlerocket-cluster).

### Pick a tool for deploying your application

- [AWS Copilot](https://aws.github.io/copilot-cli/) - The easiest starting experience for launching your local container on Fargate. This commandline tool helps you build and deploy your application, as well as deploy CI/CD pipelines that automatically rebuild and redeploy your application on Git push. It creates infrastructure as code templates for you behind the scenes.
- [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) - AWS CDK is an SDK that lets developers define and deploy AWS infrastructure using familiar programming languages, often the same language that the application itself is coded in. CDK creates CloudFormation automatically behind the scenes.
  - [aws-ecs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-cdk/aws-ecs) - This module provides simple low level constructs for creating ECS and Fargate services. It gets about 100k downloads per week on NPM, so it is quite popular as a choice.
  - [aws-ecs-patterns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-cdk/aws-ecs-patterns) - A more beginner friendly interface to CDK. These patterns help you setup simple things like a "load balanced service" or a "scheduled task"
  - [ecs-service-extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-cdk-containers/ecs-service-extensions) - This CDK module provides the most extendable interface for ECS services. It lets you deploy an ECS service and then optionally attach extensions to it, which do things like add the service to a service mesh, or add an observability sidecar, etc. Read more about [how to build custom extensions for ECS deployments](https://containersonaws.com/pattern/ecs-service-extensions-custom-extension)
- [CloudFormation](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/tree/master/aws/services/ECS) - You can choose to write CloudFormation templates to describe your deployment directly, in which case these sample templates will help. Check out [prebuilt CloudFormation patterns for AWS CloudFormation and Amazon ECS + AWS Fargate](https://containersonaws.com/pattern/?tool=cloudformation)
- [Terraform ECS Blueprints](https://catalog.workshops.aws/ecs-solution-blueprints/en-US) - Production ready AWS ECS infrastructure as code with Terraform
- [Troposphere + ECS](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere/blob/master/examples/ECSFargate.py) - For Python users [Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere) can help create CloudFormation templates. This example shows how to create an ECS deployment using Troposphere
