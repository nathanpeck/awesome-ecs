### Pick your container hosting strategy:

- <a href="#aws-fargate">AWS Fargate</a> - AWS Fargate is a technology for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters.
- <a href="#self-hosted-in-ec2">Self hosted in EC2</a> - Running your own cluster of EC2 instances to host your containers gives you the most control over price (ability to run on spot instances or reserved instances) as well as configuration.
